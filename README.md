Just another repository
Though I may never need these commands, it seemed interesting to keep them as a reference to what I had initially learned in SQL

Returning information from a Relational Database
SELECT * FROM;

Writing a statement to create a new table in an existing database
CREATE TABLE table_name(column_1 data_type, column_2 data_type, column_3 data_type);

Adding a row to a table
INSERT INTO table_name(*)
VALUES(*);
SELECT * FROM;
